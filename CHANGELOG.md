## Unreleased

- Build the docs once in CI, test the packaged static site, then deploy that
  output to Vercel. Vercel no longer rebuilds packages or installs Rust tools.
- Send IndexNow updates after a successful production deployment, not during
  the docs build.

## 0.2.0

- Hardened collaboration recovery, persistence queues, paged datasources, snapshots, and spreadsheet interchange resource boundaries.
- Replaced the optional spreadsheet implementation with a bounded OOXML codec and broadened workbook fidelity across LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, and Google Sheets fixtures.
- Improved wide-page loading, cache eviction, large-dataset performance, and browser rendering behavior.
- Added complete framework, database lifecycle, collaboration, interoperability, and million-row performance showcases.
- Added deterministic performance, delivery-size, cross-browser, package-consumer, and release verification gates.
- Successful `develop` CI runs publish only unpublished package versions from canonical artifacts, then create verified package-specific tags and GitHub Releases.
