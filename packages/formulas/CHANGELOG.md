# @sheetwrite/formulas

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#286](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/pull/286) [`a6eefc5`](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/commit/a6eefc5842d994b1ebf3ed699c74cc762c87377b) Thanks [@chh-ay](https://github.com/chh-ay)! - Hosts can register synchronous JavaScript functions that formulas call, on the full engine (`@sheetwrite/formulas`). Import `registerFunction(store, metadata, implementation)` and `unregisterFunction(store, name)` from `@sheetwrite/core/functions`; an application that does not import that entry carries none of its JavaScript, and the default engine binary does not change. On the default engine, `registerFunction` throws a `SheetwriteError` with code `optional-backend-unavailable`. A thrown error or a result that is not a number, text, boolean or `null` shows `#VALUE!`. A workbook that calls a function that is not registered shows `#NAME?`. `listFunctions(store)` returns the metadata of the built-in functions of the active engine and of the host functions in one list.

- [#301](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/pull/301) [`08fbebf`](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/commit/08fbebfd3b654070de6edbd15d4d72398eb5198d) Thanks [@chh-ay](https://github.com/chh-ay)! - Both engines export `formulaTokens(text)` and `checkFormulaSyntax(text)`. `formulaTokens` returns the tokens of formula text from the engine's own lexer as a `Uint32Array`, four numbers per token: the kind, the start and end as UTF-16 offsets, and 1 when whitespace comes before the token. It does not stop at an error: an open quote or bracket becomes one bad token to the end of the text. `checkFormulaSyntax` returns the first error of the engine's parser with its span, its message and an `incomplete` flag for a formula that ends too early, or `undefined`. Formula help in `@sheetwrite/core` uses them, so it marks exactly the formulas that the engine rejects. The parser's error messages are now sentences that a user can act on, such as "Add ) to close the (.".

- [#306](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/pull/306) [`e0c3655`](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/commit/e0c3655b1fec3b8dd5771e234d8280a7bdf9cc4f) Thanks [@chh-ay](https://github.com/chh-ay)! - `SUBTOTAL` and `AGGREGATE` skip hidden rows, as in Excel:
  
  - `SUBTOTAL` accepts codes 101 to 111. All codes skip the rows that a filter hides. Codes 101 to 111 also skip the rows that you hide (`hideRows`) and the rows of a collapsed row group. Before, codes 101 to 111 returned `#VALUE!`.
  - `SUBTOTAL` reads a cell argument, such as `A2` in `=SUBTOTAL(9,A2)`, as a reference: text in the cell is ignored, as in Excel, and the cell's row can be hidden.
  - `SUBTOTAL` skips cells whose formula calls `SUBTOTAL` or `AGGREGATE`, as `AGGREGATE` already did, so a subtotal is not counted two times.
  - `AGGREGATE` options 1, 3, 5 and 7 skip hidden rows. Before, they had no effect.
  - When you hide or show rows, collapse or expand a row group, or change a filter, only the `SUBTOTAL` and `AGGREGATE` formulas that read the sheet calculate again. Core sends the hidden rows of a sheet in one engine call per transaction.
  - New engine export `CellStore.setHiddenRows(sheet, manual, filtered)` sets the hidden rows of a sheet as packed `[first, last]` row ranges. A sheet without hidden rows uses no extra memory.

### Patch Changes

- [#307](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/pull/307) [`5620780`](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/commit/56207806761765cf486187dd1e72851813f75457) Thanks [@chh-ay](https://github.com/chh-ay)! - Paste, fill and conditional-format rules now rewrite formula references with the engine's own rules (part of [#246](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/issues/246)). `=SUM(A:A)` pasted one column right becomes `=SUM(B:B)`, and a name such as `XYZ1`, past the last column, stays a name instead of becoming `#REF!`. A row or column insert, delete or move rewrites whole columns and rows in conditional-format formulas too. Only the references that change are rewritten, so the rest of the formula keeps its spacing and case.
  
  The engines export `translateFormula`, `shiftFormulaAxis` and `moveFormulaAxis`. `shiftA1Refs` from `@sheetwrite/core` now calls the engine, so it needs `initSheetwrite()` first. `rebaseDocumentOperations` needs it too when it moves a conditional format that has a formula.

- [#300](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/pull/300) [`cfc6d1f`](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/commit/cfc6d1fae12c8e3fd6b68db0b93af83a1ccb531e) Thanks [@chh-ay](https://github.com/chh-ay)! - More functions give the Excel result:
  
  - `ROUND`, `ROUNDUP`, `ROUNDDOWN`, `FIXED` and `DOLLAR` round the decimal value that Excel shows: `=ROUND(1.005,2)` is 1.01.
  - A number becomes text with 15 significant digits, as in Excel: `=(0.1+0.2)&""` is `0.3`.
  - `TEXT` applies number format codes: percent, thousands separators, digit placeholders, scientific notation, quoted text and sections (`=TEXT(0.5,"0%")` is `50%`).
  - `CHOOSE`, `INDEX`, `ADDRESS` and other position arguments ignore a fraction: `=CHOOSE(1.5,"a","b")` is `a`. `INDEX` with a zero row or column returns the whole column or row.
  - `ADDRESS`, `MATCH`, `XMATCH` and `XLOOKUP` return an error from an argument instead of `#VALUE!`.
  - `COUNTIF(range,"<>")` and other not-equal criteria count values of another type.
  - `SUMIF` and `AVERAGEIF` read as many sum cells as the criteria range has, from the top-left sum cell.
  - `YEAR(0)`, `MONTH(0)` and `DAY(0)` are 1900, 1 and 0. `DATE` before serial 0 and date parts of a negative serial are `#NUM!`.
  - `FLOOR` and `CEILING` need two arguments, give `#NUM!` for a positive number with a negative significance, and `FLOOR(0.3,0.1)` is 0.3. `CEILING(x,0)` is 0.
  - `REPLACE` with a start past the end appends the new text. `TRIM` removes only spaces, as in Excel.
  - In the full engine, an error argument of a `LAMBDA` reaches its body, so `=LAMBDA(x,IFERROR(x,0))(1/0)` is 0.

- [#300](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/pull/300) [`cfc6d1f`](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/commit/cfc6d1fae12c8e3fd6b68db0b93af83a1ccb531e) Thanks [@chh-ay](https://github.com/chh-ay)! - Formulas accept more Excel syntax:
  
  - Numbers with an exponent, such as `=1E3` and `=SUM(1.5E-3)`.
  - Whole columns and rows, such as `=SUM(A:A)`, `=SUM($A:$C)` and `=SUM(Sheet2!1:1)`. They read only the rows and columns that the sheet has, keep their column or row through row and column edits and copies, and are written back in this short form. `ROWS(A:A)` is 1048576.
  - A name such as `XYZ1` that is past column XFD or row 1048576 is a name, not a cell.
  - A row or column edit keeps the text of a formula whose references it does not move, so `=A1+B1*2` stays as written.

- [#300](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/pull/300) [`cfc6d1f`](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/commit/cfc6d1fae12c8e3fd6b68db0b93af83a1ccb531e) Thanks [@chh-ay](https://github.com/chh-ay)! - A row or column insert that a sheet cannot hold changes nothing. `addRows`, `removeRows`, `insertCols` and `removeCols` return `false` for a dense sheet that would pass its cell limit or a row count that overflows, and the store rejects the operation instead of moving formulas, charts or metadata for cells that did not move. `addPagedSheet` throws for a chunk size above 1048576 rows.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#234](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/pull/234) [`1ceb09a`](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/commit/1ceb09a7567a99292744d8b4fd459ffc0c73b3fb) Thanks [@chh-ay](https://github.com/chh-ay)! - Recalculate faster after many single-cell writes followed by a bulk write.

- [#235](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/pull/235) [`3df2d80`](https://github.com/chh-ay/sheetwrite/commit/3df2d80d6b670d41ba5b18954befe281694a2ddd) Thanks [@chh-ay](https://github.com/chh-ay)! - Value edits in a workbook without formulas or pivot tables no longer run the formula recalculation pass. The pass is the largest function of the engine, and the WebAssembly runtime compiled it while the first edits ran, so the first thousands of edits of a data grid were slower than in 0.5.4. Calculated values and edit results do not change.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 9dc3ab1: Add reference-valued `OFFSET(reference, rows, cols, [height], [width])` and `INDIRECT(text, [a1])` in both engines and formula autocomplete. Their results can feed reference-taking functions, `LAMBDA`, `MAP` and the other array helpers, or spill multiple cells; a one-cell result is a plain value, not a spill. Both functions are volatile and recalculate with their dependents after every source-changing edit; runtime dependency cycles return `#CYCLE!`.
  
  `OFFSET` inherits omitted dimensions from its source reference and requires positive height and width. Out-of-grid bounds return `#REF!`; nonpositive dimensions, nonnumeric offsets or a non-reference first argument return `#VALUE!`. `INDIRECT` accepts A1 or R1C1 notation, including relative R1C1 coordinates, sheet-qualified references, defined names and table references. Invalid targets and external workbook references return `#REF!`. Reference text is not rewritten by fill, copy or structural edits. Existing sheet, range and spill limits still apply.
  
  OFFSET and INDIRECT are volatile, as in Excel. The engine does not record the cells they read as graph edges. Each edit recalculates them again, so a moved or edited target always shows. Workbooks without these functions do not pay this cost. `recompute(sheet)` on a sheet with volatile formulas also recalculates the volatile formulas on every other sheet, because Excel recalculates volatile functions for the whole workbook. A reference to another sheet then stays current.
- b6f333c: Add saved pivot-table calculation to the full engine. Share grouping rules with PIVOTBY. Update only affected groups after source edits, and keep MIN, MAX, and DISTINCTCOUNT correct when values are removed. Add SUM and AVERAGE values exactly and round them one time, so edits give the same result as a new calculation. Include pivot caches in memory statistics.
  
  Keep pivot output in spill state, not in formula sources. Retry output after a blocker is cleared. Recalculate formula sources and dependent formulas, retain colliding anchors after structural edits, and rebuild caches after engine memory transfer. The default engine does not include pivot calculation.
- 0b5cc2d: Add iterative calculation for circular references, as in Excel. The new `setCalculation` document operation sets `{ iterate, maxIterations, maxChange }`. The defaults are the Excel defaults: off, 100 iterations, and a maximum change of 0.001. When iteration is off, a circular reference shows `#CYCLE!`, as before. When it is on, the engine calculates each circular reference again until no value changes by more than `maxChange`, or until `maxIterations` passes are done. A cycle that does not settle keeps the values of its last pass. Formulas that read a cycle calculate once, after it settles. `OFFSET`, `INDIRECT` and volatile functions work inside a cycle, and a cycle that only `OFFSET` or `INDIRECT` closes also iterates.
  
  The setting is undoable and is part of the workbook snapshot as `workbook.calculation`. Snapshots of workbooks with the default setting do not change. XLSX import reads `iterate`, `iterateCount` and `iterateDelta` from `<calcPr>`, and export writes them. The WASM `CellStore` has the new `setIterativeCalculation` method. Core exports `CalculationSettings`, `DEFAULT_MAX_ITERATIONS`, `DEFAULT_MAX_CHANGE` and `MAX_ITERATIONS`.
  
  The engine finds circular references once per recalculation, only when the dependency check finds a cycle, so workbooks without one do no extra work.
- 34bdcba: The engine exports 10 fewer `CellStore` methods. Sheetwrite did not call them, so the grid and store APIs do not change. Removed: `canDirtyCell`, `dirtyRevision`, `markCellCleanRevision`, `hydratePageNumbers`, `hydratePageStringsPacked`, `spillOwnerCoordinates`, `isSheetAlive`, `pinRange`, `styleIdAt` and `sortRows`. If you call the engine directly, use `sortRowsMulti` with one key instead of `sortRows`, `getCell(...).style` instead of `styleIdAt`, and `setSparseBlock` inside `beginPageLoad`/`commitSources` instead of `hydratePage*`. Paged sheets no longer keep caller-owned `pinRange` pins. Viewport and read-window pins work as before.
  
  Remove the unused `SourceSnapshot.byteLength()` metric too. Source snapshots still expose all formula, reference and spill arrays. `RangeSnapshot.byteLength()` is unchanged.
- 0f36fda: Add the Excel reference operators. A space between two references is the intersection operator: `=SUM(A1:C3 B2:D4)` adds the cells that both ranges cover. When the references share no cell, or are on different sheets, the result is `#NULL!`. Spaces around other operators, after commas and before `)` do not change.
  
  A comma inside parentheses that are not a function call is the union operator: `=SUM((A1:A2,C1:C2))`. `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SMALL`, `LARGE` and the other functions that read lists of values accept a union. `INDEX` has the optional `area_num` argument, which selects one area of a union. The new `AREAS` function counts the areas of a reference. A union in a position that needs one range, such as a `VLOOKUP` table, returns `#VALUE!`.
  
  A 3-D reference such as `=SUM(Jan:Mar!B2)` or `=SUM('Jan:Q1 Close'!A1:B2)` reads the same cells on every sheet from the first to the last sheet in tab order. `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`, `COUNTA`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `PRODUCT`, `STDEV.S`, `STDEV.P`, `VAR.S` and `VAR.P` accept 3-D references; other positions return `#VALUE!`. When you insert, move or delete a sheet inside the span, the result changes as in Excel. When you delete or move an endpoint sheet, the formula moves to the nearest sheet inside the span. A rename keeps the formula valid. When every sheet of the span is deleted, the reference becomes `#REF!`. Row and column edits on one sheet do not change a 3-D reference.
  
  The three operators record only the cells they read, so an edit recalculates only the formulas that it can change. A tab move updates the dependencies of the affected formulas only. When a tab move rewrites a 3-D reference, undo restores the original formula text. XLSX import and export keep these formulas as Excel text. The WASM `CellStore` has the new `setSheetOrder` and `sheetSpanFormulaCells` methods; core calls them when tabs are added, moved or restored.
- bcfe991: Add `RAND` and `RANDBETWEEN`, and make volatile formulas recalculate after each edit. `RAND`, `RANDBETWEEN`, `TODAY` and `NOW`, and the formulas that read them, now recalculate in every transaction that changes a cell, as in Excel. Before, they recalculated only when the host called `recalculateVolatile`. A transaction without cell changes recalculates nothing. Workbooks without volatile formulas do no extra work, and the extra work of an edit grows only with the number of volatile formulas and their dependents.
  
  `RANDBETWEEN(bottom, top)` rounds `bottom` up and `top` down. It returns `#NUM!` for an empty interval and `#VALUE!` for a bound that is not a number.
  
  Add `FORMULATEXT`, `ISFORMULA`, `HYPERLINK` and `CELL`. `FORMULATEXT` returns the formula of a cell, or `#N/A` when the cell holds no formula. `HYPERLINK` returns its friendly name, or the link when there is no friendly name; the grid does not open the link. `CELL` supports the info types `address`, `col`, `contents`, `row` and `type`; other info types return `#VALUE!`. Formula autocomplete offers all six functions.
- bcfe991: `TODAY` and `NOW` now read the clock once in each recalculation, as in Excel. Every `TODAY` and `NOW` in one recalculation uses the same time. Before, they used only the time from the last `recalculateVolatile` call. `recalculateVolatile(date)` still uses the time you give it, until the next edit.

### Patch Changes

- 34bdcba: Column aggregates (`SheetwriteStore.aggregate`, the engine's `aggregate`, used by grid aggregates and status totals) now give the same result on dense sheets as on paged sheets, as Excel does. On a dense sheet, a formula that returns TRUE or FALSE counted as 1 or 0, and a formula that returns a blank counted as 0; both are now ignored. Values that a formula spills into other cells were skipped; they now count.
- 34bdcba: Dense column readers now skip the general paged-cell path where it is not needed. Style scans skip equal adjacent ids. Ordered data-edge scans classify literal kinds without resolving each cell. Text filters and numeric sort-key scans use dense slices. Paged sheets keep their load checks and eviction order. Values, style ids, sorting and navigation results do not change.
- 8d70aae: Package READMEs and API doc comments link to the restructured documentation pages.
- 34bdcba: Column aggregates (`SheetwriteStore.aggregate`, the engine's `aggregate`) on dense sheets are fast again. Since the cell storage split, they read each cell through the general cell reader. On a 100,000-row column, SUM was 2.6× slower than in 0.5.4, and COUNT over mixed values was 6× slower. They now scan the column directly. Results do not change.
- 957b82f: Use coordinate-keyed hashing for engine cell indexes while retaining randomized hashing for workbook text. Content clears, packed writes, and column writes retain unrelated calculated values and spills and recalculate only their dependent formulas, including cross-sheet and range readers. Large rectangles use bounded range dirty tracking instead of whole-sheet invalidation; style-only clears do not invalidate calculations.
  
  Consolidate engine ownership: CellStorage owns paged storage and local dirty overlays; graph owns formula entries, the dependency index, and recompute dirty state; spill admission accesses cells through storage; window owns conditional-rule caching. Dirty-state memory accounting and internal memory transfers preserve the active cell, rectangle, or whole-sheet representation.
  
  Pack formula source errors, volatility, spill-reference and array-production predicates, and persisted source kind into one byte of per-formula metadata. Parsed formula entries retain the owned source string without copying it; persisted engine-transfer bytes remain unchanged.
  
  Formula edits, clears, column loads and range restores patch the dependency index in place instead of rebuilding it for the whole workbook; only structural edits or a batch that rewrites a large share of the formulas rebuild it.
  
  Circular-reference and nesting-depth checks no longer overflow the stack on long formula chains, and many formulas reading the same large overlapping ranges no longer take quadratic memory.
  
  Release oversized dependency-reader allocations after topology edits. Dense streamed ranges use their existing source slices without a per-column page cache, and paged readers cap their temporary run cache.
  
  Literal-only block writes and history restores on dense sheets write storage column by column instead of cell by cell, and `SUM` reads literal cells without resolving their calculated kind.
- 3bdb073: The packages are smaller to install. The code is not minified and stays readable.
  
  - `@sheetwrite/core` is 1.83 MB → 1.55 MB unpacked (387 KB → 350 KB packed), with 214 → 157 files.
  - The packages publish only the type declarations that their entry points use. Core no longer ships 57 internal declaration files (117 KB), and `@sheetwrite/xlsx` no longer ships 8. You cannot import these files through the package `exports`, so no types change.
  - The published JavaScript uses 2-space indentation instead of 4. This saves 155 KB in core and 20 KB in `@sheetwrite/xlsx`.
  - `@sheetwrite/wasm` and `@sheetwrite/formulas` no longer publish `pkg/sheetwrite_wasm_bg.wasm.d.ts` (14 KB each). No entry point refers to it, and `sheetwrite_wasm.d.ts` has the same types.

## 0.5.4

### Patch Changes

- aba7c92: Release with the other packages so all seven share one version. The engine does not change.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- 222a3f8: Publish readable JavaScript again. 0.5.2 removed whitespace from the published files, so stack traces pointed into one long line and the code in `node_modules` was hard to read and debug. Your bundler still minifies your app build. Module paths, exports, and type documentation do not change.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 2e4231c: Remove comments and extra whitespace from published JavaScript to reduce package download and installed sizes. Keep module paths, exported names, type documentation, and WebAssembly binaries unchanged.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 7d9b52a: Add checked API examples and links for grid setup, data, synchronization, framework components, engine selection, and XLSX import and export.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a320510: Apply formula operators to each array element. Scalars and single rows or columns expand to match the other operand. Array results spill into adjacent cells and work as arguments to functions that accept arrays.
- 87a5085: Add DATEDIF, ISOWEEKNUM, NETWORKDAYS.INTL, and WORKDAY.INTL. Add 15 financial functions for cash flows, loan totals, interest rates, and depreciation. The default engine does not change.
- a779932: Add descriptive statistics, ranking and simple linear regression to the full formula engine: `AVEDEV`, `DEVSQ`, `HARMEAN`, `KURT`, `SKEW`, `SKEW.P`, `TRIMMEAN`, `PERCENTILE.EXC`, `QUARTILE.EXC`, `PERCENTRANK.INC`, `PERCENTRANK.EXC`, `RANK.AVG`, `PEARSON`, `RSQ`, `SLOPE`, `INTERCEPT`, `STEYX`, and `FORECAST.LINEAR` (also spelled `FORECAST`). They use the Excel argument rules: a cell argument is a reference, so text in that cell is ignored, and regression functions skip pairs where either value is not a number. `PERCENTRANK` results are truncated to the requested significant digits, as in Excel. The default `@sheetwrite/wasm` engine does not change.
- 9915236: Add `releaseEngineMemory()`. Call it when the app is idle, for example after a large clear or after a big sheet closes. It moves every live store into a fresh WASM instance and lets the browser free the old instance's memory, which a WASM instance never gives back by itself. Cached formula results, loaded datasource pages, unsaved edits and undo/redo history move with the stores. If any store cannot move, all stores stay on the old instance and nothing changes. The returned report gives the WASM bytes before and after and the pause.
  
  After a three-column, million-row sheet is cleared down to ten rows, WASM memory drops from 173 MiB to 38 MiB, the size of a freshly built store with the same content. Release never makes WASM memory larger. The pause grows with the live data: about 50 ms in that case, and up to about 270 ms when undo history for the cleared million rows is kept.
  
  Both engine loaders can create independent instances from shared compiled code. For direct engine use, `load()`, `isLoaded()`, `initSync()` and the synchronous exports keep working. The default engine grows by about 9 KB (Brotli).
  
  **Breaking:** core now owns its own engine instance, so `await initSheetwrite()` is required before you create a Grid or a `SheetwriteStore`. Calling only `load()` from `@sheetwrite/wasm` or `@sheetwrite/formulas` no longer initializes core; the error message now says so. Apps that already call `initSheetwrite()` need no change.
- 11e9336: Keep calculated formula values and spill output separate from written cell sources. Hydrating a source into spill output now preserves the source and reports `#SPILL!`; paged formulas request unknown spill destinations as calculation prerequisites. History captures source cells rather than calculated output, including fallback history for custom stores.
  
  For direct `CellStore` users, finish staged edits or page loads with `commitSources()`, which completes recalculation and collects eligible string-pool garbage after local edits. Page loads retain the existing deferred-collection policy. This replaces `endMutation()`, `endPageLoad()`, and `recomputeChanged()`. `admitSourceRange()` checks spill admission in Rust without transferring an owner window.
  
  Bulk source loads invalidate calculated output once per range, avoiding per-cell spill teardown and redundant dirty-cell tracking before whole-sheet recalculation.
  
  Formula range evaluation decodes literal source payloads directly, keeping calculated-overlay resolution off literal scans while retaining source precedence for spill output.
  
  Calculated errors share the same tagged overlay slots as other formula results, avoiding a separate error hash table and its per-result allocation and lookup costs.
  
  Engine memory release transfers calculated overlay slots and spill ownership independently of source storage, preserving cached volatile values, calculated errors, blocked spills, and compact undo history without recalculation.
- b8dbb50: Add `@sheetwrite/formulas`, an optional full formula engine. It is the same Rust engine as `@sheetwrite/wasm`, built with more functions, and it has the same API and loaders. The full engine is a separate build: it adds nothing to the function set or binary of the default `@sheetwrite/wasm` engine.
  
  - Select the full engine one time, before the app creates a grid or a store: `import * as formulas from "@sheetwrite/formulas"; await initSheetwrite(undefined, formulas);`. A call that selects a different engine after this rejects. Calls without an engine keep the selected engine, so framework adapters work with both engines.
  - The full engine adds 36 statistical distribution functions: `NORM.DIST`, `NORM.INV`, `NORM.S.DIST`, `NORM.S.INV`, `T.DIST`, `T.DIST.2T`, `T.DIST.RT`, `T.INV`, `T.INV.2T`, `CHISQ.DIST`, `CHISQ.DIST.RT`, `CHISQ.INV`, `CHISQ.INV.RT`, `F.DIST`, `F.DIST.RT`, `F.INV`, `F.INV.RT`, `BINOM.DIST`, `POISSON.DIST`, `EXPON.DIST`, `GAMMA`, `GAMMALN`, `GAMMA.DIST`, `GAMMA.INV`, `BETA.DIST`, `BETA.INV`, `LOGNORM.DIST`, `LOGNORM.INV`, `WEIBULL.DIST`, `CONFIDENCE.NORM`, `CONFIDENCE.T`, `STANDARDIZE`, `FISHER`, `FISHERINV`, `PHI`, and `GAUSS`. They use the Excel argument rules and error values.
  - Formula assist suggests only the functions of the selected engine. With the default engine, these functions return `#NAME?`.
  - In this release, the full engine binary is 1,074,934 bytes (326,278 bytes with Brotli) and the default engine binary is 791,937 bytes (238,071 bytes with Brotli).
- b072a35: Add GROUPBY, PIVOTBY, and PERCENTOF to the full engine. Summaries support multiple fields, headers, filters, totals, subtotals, field and value sorting, and single built-in or LAMBDA aggregators. Vectors of aggregator functions are not supported. Grouping and output use the existing spill and work limits. The default engine does not include these functions.
- 2deec77: Add LAMBDA, MAP, REDUCE, SCAN, BYROW, BYCOL, MAKEARRAY, and ISOMITTED to the full formula engine. Support immediate invocation, lexical parameters, LET-bound functions, and bounded recursion. Keep the default engine unchanged.
- 2ea968e: Add database criteria functions and more math functions to the full engine. Add matrix multiplication, inverse, determinant, and identity arrays. Keep the default engine unchanged.
- ee4d45a: Add MODE.MULT and SORTBY to the full formula engine. MODE.MULT returns every most frequent value as a column, in the order of first occurrence. SORTBY sorts the rows or columns of an array by one or more key arrays, each ascending or descending, and keeps equal items in their order.
- dad4691: Add the LINEST, LOGEST, TREND, GROWTH, and FREQUENCY array functions to the full engine. Regression supports more than one predictor, the `const` argument, five rows of fit statistics, and removal of collinear predictors. With `const=FALSE`, linear fits use an intercept of zero and exponential fits use a multiplier of one. Add PROB and the legacy PERCENTILE, PERCENTRANK, QUARTILE, and RANK names. The default engine does not change.
- 2af5b21: Add TOCOL, TOROW, WRAPROWS, WRAPCOLS, EXPAND, HSTACK, and VSTACK to the full formula engine. The functions support scan order, blank and error filtering, padding, and dynamic spill sizes. The default engine is unchanged.
- 35e8450: Add TEXTBEFORE, TEXTAFTER, TEXTSPLIT, FIXED, DOLLAR, VALUETOTEXT, ARRAYTOTEXT, REGEXTEST, REGEXEXTRACT, and REGEXREPLACE to the full engine. TEXTSPLIT and regex extraction can spill results. Regex uses the regex-lite syntax. Patterns that require lookaround, backreferences, or Unicode classes return #VALUE!. Case-insensitive matching folds ASCII letters only. The default engine does not include regex.

### Patch Changes

- f25513a: Support array constants in formulas. Preserve their row and column shape for spills and array arguments, and preserve their values through formula edits and XLSX round trips.
- 0241abd: Allocate dense calculated values in lazy 512-cell chunks instead of reserving an entire sheet on its first formula. Empty chunks are released when spills shrink, and memory-release transfers retain only populated chunks.
  
  Track live chunks so empty-overlay reads and source writes keep their fast paths. Resolve scalar spill kinds and payloads together to avoid repeated chunk lookups. Avoid wide range-cache allocations for single-row scans, and check paged-cell load state before reading its payload.
- 837eb95: Store analysis function names as compact registry identifiers. This keeps function values small when the full engine is selected. Formula names and results do not change.
- 1240c84: Reduce repeated indexing in matrix calculations and avoid allocation in sums of squares.
- c6674f9: Reduce memory allocation in formula array operations.
- d137ff0: Reduce calculation time for text, calendar, and financial formulas without changing their results.
- 7f73dc7: Reduce the time to calculate WORKDAY, UNIQUE, and SEARCH formulas.
- b771aa0: Reduce calculation work for statistical formulas without changing results.
- ddaac0d: Fix FILTER in debug builds when its input array has fewer cells than its static size bound. FILTER uses the evaluated array size for its result.
- d63ac3d: An edit that changes only formula constants keeps the dependency index, so the
  next recompute does not rebuild it for the whole workbook. Sparse, packed, and
  scalar writes now share one source-replacement module.
- 64aebd9: Release decoded lookup ranges when recalculation ends, including early returns. Lookup results do not change.
- 2c26d4c: Skip spill and formula metadata lookups when the metadata is empty. This reduces the time to load one million rows by 35% in the measured mixed-column workload. The default WebAssembly file grows by 718 bytes (0.09%) for this improvement.
- 11e8edd: Fix a spill that reads another spill showing the previous values. When the spill it reads is placed later in the same recalculation, the reading spill is now calculated again. Spills that read each other show #CYCLE!.
- e725d98: Support spill references such as `A1#`. A spill reference refers to the current spill of its anchor cell and follows it when the spill changes size. It returns `#REF!` when the anchor holds no spill. Row and column edits move the reference with its anchor. XLSX import and export convert it to and from `_xlfn.ANCHORARRAY`.
- 99435f8: Keep painted and frozen cells resident during unrelated bulk reads. Load the same-sheet formula dependencies of frozen cells and reached merge anchors, and retain the bounded formula closure while its window is visible. Give bulk reads transient pins separate from viewport protection and caller-owned WASM `pinRange` pins.
