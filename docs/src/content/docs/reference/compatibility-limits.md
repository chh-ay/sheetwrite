title: Compatibility and limits
description: Explicit compatibility boundaries, resource ceilings, tuning defaults, limit behavior, and override paths.
---

| Area | Supported contract | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data | Eager columnar data or cancellable datasource pages; dense and allocation-lazy paged storage | Full-sheet queries and exports are incomplete until required pages load |
| Formulas | Persisted formula source, A1/range references, named ranges, the inventory-derived supported function contract, bounded lexical `LET`, and bounded dynamic-array spills | No blanket Excel/Sheets/OpenFormula claim; external/network/database/cube/LAMBDA categories and automatic volatility beyond the clock barrier are unsupported |
| Protection | Serializable client interaction policy with atomic/partial local mutation behavior | Never server authorization; remote operations bypass local UX policy |
| Collaboration | Host sequencing, stable mutation IDs, durable optimistic edits, ordered remote operations, presence/comments/revisions, conservative rebase | No bundled server, CRDT, or general OT; ambiguous structural/formula conflicts require host UX |
| Worker | OffscreenCanvas rendering with capability/startup fallback | Custom function renderers cannot transfer to the worker |
| XLSX | Table interchange plus supported workbook formulas/styles/merges/dimensions/frozen panes/names and Sheetwrite metadata | Unsupported workbook features are warned, flattened, or dropped; not full Excel fidelity |
| Accessibility | ARIA grid mirror for the visible virtualized window with keyboard-driven updates | The full document is not duplicated into hidden DOM |

Compatibility statements are feature contracts, not claims of Excel or Google Sheets parity.

The [detailed compatibility results](/docs/reference/compatibility-results/) link each formula, workbook, clipboard, and XLSX status to its evidence record and exact difference.

The [generated formula function contract](/docs/reference/formula-functions/) publishes names, families, signatures, behavior profiles, source links, implementation evidence, and unsupported categories directly from the checked versioned inventory.

The tables below describe the owning source definition, not generated API signatures. Ceilings are inclusive unless a row says otherwise. MiB means 1,048,576 bytes. “Compatibility” identifies an external or product boundary; “resource defense” identifies bounded allocation or retained state; “interaction tuning” identifies a non-failing operational default.

## Rendering, interaction, and paged data

| Owner / resource | Default and unit | Why / evidence class | Behavior at the boundary | Supported override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GridOptions.overscan` / `DEFAULT_OVERSCAN` | 6 row and visible-column positions per viewport edge | Interaction tuning: keep the virtual paint and ARIA windows close to the viewport | It is not a document ceiling; the window is clipped to available rows/columns | `GridOptions.overscan` or `grid.setOverscan()`; `0` disables the buffer |
| `measureMaxElementHeight` | Measured browser clamp minus 4,096 CSS px; 15,000,000 CSS px fallback | Compatibility: browser layout and scroll-offset clamps vary | Taller logical sheets use scaled scrolling while the DOM sizer stays at the safe clamp | Not configurable |
| `AUTO_FIT_CHUNK_CELLS` | 16,384 cells per store read | Resource defense: bound one synchronous auto-fit read | Larger scans continue in frame-scheduled chunks and commit after the scan | Not configurable |
| `DEFAULT_COL_WIDTH` | 100 CSS px | Interaction tuning: keep synthesized sheet and padding columns consistent | Used for generated columns; it is not a width ceiling | No global setting; supply or update individual column widths |
| [`DEFAULT_SIMPLE_COLUMN_WIDTH`](/docs/api/core-adapter/default-simple-column-width/) | 120 CSS px | Interaction tuning: give adapter-created schemas an explicit usable width | Used only when a simple column omits `width` | `SimpleColumn.width` |
| `DataSourceStorageOptions.chunkRows` / `DEFAULT_PAGE_CHUNK_ROWS` | 4,096 rows per chunk | Resource defense: allocation-lazy page granularity | Chunks allocate on load/edit; a positive non-power-of-two value is rounded up to a power of two | `GridOptions.datasourceStorage.chunkRows` or `SheetwriteStoreOptions.chunkRows` |
| `DataSourceStorageOptions.cacheBytes` / `DEFAULT_PAGED_CACHE_BYTES` | 32 MiB per paged sheet | Resource defense: bound clean cached chunks | Before a new chunk would exceed the budget, the least-recent clean, unpinned chunks are evicted; dirty/visible chunks may exceed it | `GridOptions.datasourceStorage.cacheBytes` or `SheetwriteStoreOptions.cacheBytes`; `0` disables eviction |
| `DataSourceStorageOptions.dirtyCellLimit` / `DEFAULT_PAGED_DIRTY_CELL_LIMIT` | 1,000,000 sparse local cells per paged sheet | Resource defense: bound dirty overlay memory independently of clean cached chunks | A transaction that would add cell 1,000,001 is rejected atomically with a `paged-dirty-cells` resource-limit issue; rewrites of already-dirty cells do not consume more capacity | `GridOptions.datasourceStorage.dirtyCellLimit` or `SheetwriteStoreOptions.dirtyCellLimit` |
| `Grid.distinctValues` | 1,000 distinct values | Resource defense: bound the default filter-menu result | Returns the first 1,000 distinct resolved values in first-seen order | Pass `limit`; `0` requests an uncapped scan |
| `UndoManager` | 200 transactions | Resource defense: bound retained undo resources | Pushing entry 201 disposes the oldest undo entry | Not configurable through the public `Grid` API |

The accessibility mirror uses the same virtual window and overscan as the canvas; it has no separate full-document DOM budget. See [datasource paging and storage](/docs/guides/configuration/#datasource-pages), [data operations](/docs/guides/data-operations/), and [the visible-window accessibility limit](/docs/guides/accessibility/#limitation-the-mirror-reflects-the-visible-window).

## Formula evaluation

| Owner / resource | Default and unit | Why / evidence class | Behavior at the boundary | Supported override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PARSE_RECURSION_LIMIT` | 256 nested parser levels | Resource defense: bound recursive formula parsing | Deeper syntax is a malformed formula and resolves to `#VALUE!` | Not configurable |
| `FORMULA_RECURSION_LIMIT` | 256 dependency/evaluation levels | Resource defense: bound recursive dependency evaluation | A deeper dependency or expression resolves to `#NUM!` | Not configurable |
| `RANGE_CELL_LIMIT` | 1,000,000 materialized cells per formula range | Resource defense: bound range/matrix allocation | An oversized range resolves to `#NUM!` | Not configurable |
| `SPILL_MAX_ROWS` / `SPILL_MAX_COLS` | 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns per matrix | Compatibility and resource defense: match worksheet axes before allocation | An invalid or oversized dimension resolves to `#NUM!` | Not configurable |
| `SPILL_MAX_CELLS` / `SPILL_MAX_BYTES` | 1,000,000 cells and 64 MiB value/intermediate storage per matrix operation | Resource defense: bound dynamic arrays, criteria matrices, transforms, and spill materialization | Preflight or materialization resolves to `#NUM!`; no truncated matrix is installed | Not configurable |
| `SPILL_MAX_RECOMPUTE_CELLS` | 2,000,000 cell operations per dynamic recompute | Resource defense: bound filtering, sorting, uniqueness comparisons, and transforms | The operation resolves to `#NUM!`; spill publication remains atomic | Not configurable |
| `LET_BINDING_LIMIT` | 126 lexical bindings per `LET` | Resource defense: bound binding state and source expansion | Binding 127 resolves to `#VALUE!` | Not configurable |
| `LET_EXPANDED_NODE_LIMIT` | 16,384 reachable expanded AST nodes | Resource defense: bound lazy substitution, including repeated bindings | The first node above the ceiling resolves to `#NUM!`; unused bindings do not consume expansion work | Not configurable |
| `MAX_TEXT_OUTPUT_BYTES` / `MAX_SEARCH_STEPS` | 16 MiB generated text and 4,000,000 bounded search steps | Resource defense: bound Unicode output and text search/substitution work | Excess work resolves to `#NUM!` | Not configurable |
| Financial root solver | 14 bracket steps, 100 solve steps, fixed `1e-12` tolerances | Determinism and resource defense for `IRR`/`RATE` | Invalid domains or non-convergence resolve to `#NUM!` | Not configurable |

See [formula functions, exact semantics, errors, and compatibility](/docs/guides/formulas/) and the [inventory-generated function reference](/docs/reference/formula-functions/).

## Transactions and snapshots

[`DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_RESOURCE_LIMITS`](/docs/api/core/default-transaction-resource-limits/) owns the atomic mutation defaults. A transaction at the ceiling is accepted; exceeding either ceiling returns a `resource-limit` rejection and applies none of an atomic transaction.

| Owner / resource | Default and unit | Why / evidence class | Behavior above the ceiling | Supported override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxOperations` | 10,000 `DocumentOp` objects per transaction | Resource defense: bound object-heavy validation and dispatch | Transaction is rejected | `GridOptions.transactionResourceLimits`, `SheetwriteStoreOptions.transactionResourceLimits`, or an explicit limit passed to `validateTransactionResources` |
| `maxEncodedBytes` | 8 MiB of UTF-8 JSON per operation array | Resource defense: bound exact payload inspection | Transaction is rejected | Same paths as `maxOperations` |

Ordinary host transactions keep these limits. Undo and redo first try a lossless `restoreBlock` operation when a packed restore exceeds the byte limit. A 1,000 × 1,000 number clear and a 300,000-cell text clear can fit one version without raising either 8 MiB limit.

`restoreBlock` carries base64 raw DEFLATE of UTF-8 JSON for a `PackedCellBlock`. Each block is limited to 64 MiB of decoded JSON and 4,000,000 cells. Validation checks the compressed stream, exact decoded size, cell dimensions, values, formulas, references, and styles before mutation. These expansion ceilings are fixed.

If compact encoding cannot fit, the Grid splits packed restores into smaller operations and applies them as one atomic batch. The batch keeps one undo step and one committed change event. Sync requires an adapter with `commitBatch`; each member version still passes the normal 8 MiB and operation limits. The whole batch has at most 16 versions and 64 MiB of encoded operations. A peer applies all members once or none. These larger internal ceilings are not available to host `applyTransaction` calls.

If the restore exceeds the batch ceilings, cannot be split, or needs an unsupported adapter method, `grid.undo()` changes nothing and emits `mutation-rejected`. A fixed-limit rejection removes that entry so older edits remain undoable. Hosts and peers must support `restoreBlock` and batch metadata before exchanging these versions. Existing operation kinds and host result/event behavior do not change. XLSX export reads restored values from the document; it does not store the compressed operation.

[`DEFAULT_SNAPSHOT_RESOURCE_LIMITS`](/docs/api/core/default-snapshot-resource-limits/) owns validation and allocation defaults. Exceeding one produces a path-qualified validation error or `SnapshotResourceError` before store allocation; an allocation failure within a configured ceiling still surfaces as a resource failure.

| Owner / resource | Default and unit | Why / evidence class | Behavior above the ceiling | Supported override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxSheets` | 256 sheets per workbook | Resource defense: bound sheet-indexed schema/store state | Snapshot or direct workbook construction is rejected | `SnapshotValidationOptions.resourceLimits`, `SheetwriteStoreOptions.snapshotResourceLimits`, or `SnapshotGridOptions.snapshotResourceLimits` |
| `maxRowsPerSheet` | 1,000,000 rows per sheet | Compatibility: million-row allocation-lazy sheet contract | Rejected before allocation | Same snapshot resource-limit paths |
| `maxColumnsPerSheet` | 16,384 columns per sheet | Compatibility: worksheet width shared with XLSX | Rejected before allocation | Same snapshot resource-limit paths |
| `maxMetadataEntries` | 1,000,000 aggregate entries | Resource defense: bound names and sheet metadata collections | Rejected during resource preflight | Same snapshot resource-limit paths |
| `maxSerializedBytes` | 64 MiB of UTF-8 JSON | Resource defense: bound snapshot JSON-safety inspection | Validation returns a resource-limit error | Same snapshot resource-limit paths |
| `maxLogicalCellsPerSheet` | 4,294,967,295 row-by-column cells per sheet | Resource defense: cap logical area even when paged storage defers allocation | Rejected before dense or paged allocation | Same snapshot resource-limit paths |
| `maxDenseCells` | 5,000,000 aggregate cells per dense workbook | Resource defense: bound eager allocation | Dense construction is rejected; paged storage does not consume this budget | Same snapshot resource-limit paths; choose `storage: "paged"` for allocation-lazy data |

See [persistence and recovery](/docs/guides/persistence/) and [document operations](/docs/reference/document-operations/).

## Delimited text

[`DEFAULT_DELIMITED_TEXT_RESOURCE_LIMITS`](/docs/api/core/default-delimited-text-resource-limits/) owns synchronous CSV/TSV defaults. Except for the writer window, exceeding a ceiling throws `DelimitedTextResourceError` before the next oversized parse/encode allocation; no partial string is returned.

| Resource | Default and unit | Why / evidence class | Behavior at or above the boundary | Supported override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxInputBytes` | 32 MiB UTF-8 input | Resource defense: bound the caller-owned string before parser allocations | At the ceiling parses; above it throws | `DelimitedTextOptions.resourceLimits.maxInputBytes` |
| `maxOutputBytes` | 64 MiB UTF-8 output, including BOM | Resource defense: bound the single returned string | At the ceiling returns; above it throws | `DelimitedTextOptions.resourceLimits.maxOutputBytes` |
| `maxRows` | 1,000,000 syntactic records | Compatibility: million-row data contract | Record 1,000,001 throws | `DelimitedTextOptions.resourceLimits.maxRows` |
| `maxColumns` | 16,384 fields in one record | Compatibility: worksheet width | Field 16,385 in one record throws | `DelimitedTextOptions.resourceLimits.maxColumns` |
| `maxCells` | 1,000,000 aggregate fields | Resource defense: bound parser arrays and encoder work | Aggregate field 1,000,001 throws | `DelimitedTextOptions.resourceLimits.maxCells` |
| `maxFieldBytes` | 1 MiB decoded UTF-8 per field | Resource defense: prevent one quoted field dominating memory | One byte above the ceiling throws | `DelimitedTextOptions.resourceLimits.maxFieldBytes` |
| `maxWriterWindowRows` | 4,096 rows per packed store read | Resource defense: bound each synchronous store window | Export continues with the next window; this is not a total-row ceiling | `DelimitedTextOptions.resourceLimits.maxWriterWindowRows` |

The override object accepts positive safe integers. CSV and TSV still return complete in-memory strings; raising byte/cell ceilings is not streaming. See [data import and export](/docs/guides/data-operations/#export).

## Synchronization and presence

[`DEFAULT_SYNC_COORDINATOR_LIMITS`](/docs/api/core/default-sync-coordinator-limits/) owns remote-input and durable-queue defaults. All fields accept positive safe-integer overrides through `SyncCoordinatorOptions.limits`.

| Resource | Default and unit | Why / evidence class | Behavior at or above the boundary | Supported override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxMutationIdBytes` | 256 UTF-8 bytes per mutation ID | Resource defense: IDs cross transport and persistence boundaries | At the ceiling accepted; an oversized ID is a typed protocol error | `limits.maxMutationIdBytes` |
| `maxOperationsPerVersion` | 10,000 operations per remote version | Resource defense: match one atomic transaction | At the ceiling accepted; above it emits a protocol error and reload requirement | `limits.maxOperationsPerVersion` |
| `maxVersionPayloadBytes` | 8 MiB UTF-8 JSON per remote version | Resource defense: match one atomic transaction payload | At the ceiling accepted; above it emits a protocol error and reload requirement | `limits.maxVersionPayloadBytes` |
| `maxBatchVersions` | 16 versions per atomic batch | Resource defense: bound one all-or-nothing step | More versions are rejected before local or peer mutation | `limits.maxBatchVersions`; may only lower the fixed ceiling |
| `maxBatchBytes` | 64 MiB aggregate encoded operations per batch | Resource defense: bound assembled batch payload | Oversized batches are rejected without applying a member | `limits.maxBatchBytes`; may only lower the fixed ceiling |
| `maxFutureVersionDistance` | 1,024 versions ahead | Recovery bound: avoid retaining an unbounded gap | A greater distance clears the gap buffer and requests reload/recovery | `limits.maxFutureVersionDistance` |
| `maxBufferedVersions` | 256 future versions | Resource defense: bound retained gap count | The next version clears the gap buffer and requests reload/recovery | `limits.maxBufferedVersions` |
| `maxBufferedOperations` | 40,000 aggregate operations | Resource defense: bound retained gap work | The operation that would exceed it clears the gap buffer and requests reload/recovery | `limits.maxBufferedOperations` |
| `maxBufferedBytes` | 32 MiB aggregate UTF-8 JSON | Resource defense: bound retained gap payloads | The operation that would exceed it clears the gap buffer and requests reload/recovery | `limits.maxBufferedBytes` |
| `maxRecentAcknowledgements` | 4,096 mutation IDs | Resource defense: bound echo-deduplication state | The oldest ID expires; a later stale echo is a reload-requiring protocol violation | `limits.maxRecentAcknowledgements` |
| `maxPendingCommits` | 10,000 pending commits | Durability bound: cap retained offline work | At the ceiling capacity is `full`; another local transaction is rejected atomically | `limits.maxPendingCommits` |
| `maxPendingOperations` | 100,000 aggregate pending operations | Durability bound: cap retained offline work | At the ceiling capacity is `full`; a transaction that would exceed it is rejected | `limits.maxPendingOperations` |
| `maxPendingEncodedBytes` | 128 MiB aggregate UTF-8 JSON | Durability bound: cap retained offline payloads | At the ceiling capacity is `full`; a transaction that would exceed it is rejected | `limits.maxPendingEncodedBytes` |

`PresenceCoordinator` owns its independent ephemeral defaults:

| Resource | Default and unit | Why / evidence class | Behavior at the boundary | Supported override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `heartbeatMs` | 15,000 ms | Interaction tuning: periodic publish and stale pruning | Timer publishes/prunes each interval | `PresenceCoordinatorOptions.heartbeatMs`; `0` disables the timer |
| `timeoutMs` | 45,000 ms | Interaction tuning: three default heartbeat intervals of silence | An actor at or beyond the idle cutoff is expired | `PresenceCoordinatorOptions.timeoutMs` |
| `maxActors` | 32 remote actors | Resource defense: bound overlay state | Receiving a new actor at capacity evicts the oldest actor | `PresenceCoordinatorOptions.maxActors` (minimum 1) |
| `maxRangesPerActor` | 8 selection ranges | Resource defense: bound payload and overlay work | Additional outbound/inbound ranges are truncated | `PresenceCoordinatorOptions.maxRangesPerActor` (minimum 1) |

See [durable commits, version gaps, and presence](/docs/guides/collaboration/).

## XLSX codec

[`DEFAULT_XLSX_RESOURCE_LIMITS`](/docs/api/core/default-xlsx-resource-limits/) owns every optional codec path. Each ceiling is inclusive; exceeding one throws `XlsxResourceError` and returns no partial workbook. Override `maxCells` through `XlsxWorkbookOptions.maxCells`; override every other field through `XlsxWorkbookOptions.resourceLimits`.

| Resource | Default and unit | Why / evidence class | Behavior above the ceiling | Supported override |

| `maxOutputBytes` | 128 MiB encoded output | Resource defense: bound the returned byte array | Export throws during preflight or after encoding | `resourceLimits.maxOutputBytes` |
| `maxArchiveEntries` | 1,024 ZIP entries | Resource defense: bound archive fan-out | Import/export throws | `resourceLimits.maxArchiveEntries` |
| `maxEntryUncompressedBytes` | 64 MiB per ZIP entry | Resource defense: bound one inflated/encoded part | Import/export throws | `resourceLimits.maxEntryUncompressedBytes` |
| `maxTotalUncompressedBytes` | 256 MiB aggregate ZIP content | Resource defense: bound total inflated/encoded parts | Import/export throws | `resourceLimits.maxTotalUncompressedBytes` |
| `maxCompressionRatio` | 100:1 uncompressed/compressed | Resource defense: reject zip-bomb-like entries | Import throws | `resourceLimits.maxCompressionRatio` |
| `maxSheets` | 256 worksheets | Resource defense: bound workbook collections | Import/export throws | `resourceLimits.maxSheets` |
| `maxRowsPerSheet` | 1,048,576 rows per worksheet | Compatibility: SpreadsheetML worksheet height | Import/export throws | `resourceLimits.maxRowsPerSheet` |
| `maxColumnsPerSheet` | 16,384 columns per worksheet | Compatibility: SpreadsheetML worksheet width | Import/export throws | `resourceLimits.maxColumnsPerSheet` |
| `maxCells` | 1,000,000 cells accounted by the conversion path | Resource defense: bound conversion work | Import/export throws | Top-level `XlsxWorkbookOptions.maxCells` |
| `maxMerges` | 100,000 aggregate merged ranges | Resource defense: bound merge collections | Import/export throws | `resourceLimits.maxMerges` |
| `maxSharedStrings` | 1,000,000 shared-string entries | Resource defense: bound the shared-string table | Import throws | `resourceLimits.maxSharedStrings` |
| `maxStyles` | 65,536 style-related records | Resource defense: bound style tables | Import/export throws | `resourceLimits.maxStyles` |
| `maxXmlElements` | 2,000,000 elements per XML part | Resource defense: bound parser nodes | Import throws | `resourceLimits.maxXmlElements` |
| `maxXmlDepth` | 64 nested elements per XML part | Resource defense: bound parser nesting | Import throws | `resourceLimits.maxXmlDepth` |
| `maxXmlAttributesPerElement` | 128 attributes per element | Resource defense: bound per-node parsing | Import throws | `resourceLimits.maxXmlAttributesPerElement` |
| `maxXmlTextBytes` | 16 MiB UTF-8 text per element or attribute | Resource defense: bound XML text accumulation | Import/export throws | `resourceLimits.maxXmlTextBytes` |

Table and workbook conversions account cells according to the active path (for example, table export accounts its rectangular table). Raising dimensions does not add fidelity for unsupported workbook features. See [XLSX compatibility](/docs/guides/data-operations/#xlsx-compatibility).
