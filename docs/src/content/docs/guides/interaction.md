[Installation](/docs/start/installation/)

Sheetwrite handles selection, keyboard navigation, inline editing, the clipboard,
the toolbar, merges, and drag-to-fill out of the box. The host element is made
focusable (`tabindex="0"`) so it receives keyboard events. Setting
`readOnly: true` disables every mutating interaction below (editing, clearing,
fill, paste, and restyling) while leaving navigation and selection intact.

## Selection model

A `Selection` is one of five shapes:

```ts prelude="core" partial="requires surrounding host state" title="Partial example"
type Selection =
  | { kind: "cell"; addr: CellAddress }
  | { kind: "range"; range: Range }
  | { kind: "row"; sheet: SheetId; row: number }
  | { kind: "column"; sheet: SheetId; col: number }
  | { kind: "multi"; ranges: Range[] };
```

Read or set it imperatively, and subscribe to changes:

```ts prelude="core" partial="requires surrounding host state" title="Partial example"
const sel = grid.getSelection();
grid.setSelection({ kind: "cell", addr: { sheet: "sheet1", row: 0, col: 0 } });
grid.setSelection(null); // clear

grid.on("selection", (e) => console.log(e.selection));
```

How selections are made with the mouse (primary button):

| Gesture | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Click a cell | Select that cell. |
| Drag across cells | Extend to a **range**. |
| Shift-click | Extend the range from the current anchor. |
| Ctrl/Cmd-click | Add a region — produces a **multi** selection. |
| Click a column letter (top header) | Select that **column** (Shift extends; Ctrl/Cmd adds). |

Row and full-column selections are part of the model. Column selection is wired to
the top header; **row selection is programmatic only** — there is no row-header
click gesture, so set it via `setSelection({ kind: "row", sheet, row })`.

Only the pointer that began a drag can change it. Switching sheets, changing
sheet structure or the sorted/filtered view, or losing pointer capture ends the
gesture; a later pointer release cannot apply it to a different sheet or view.

## Resizing

Drag a column-header boundary or a row-header boundary to preview its size.
The preview changes geometry only: the document and undo history remain intact
until release. Release submits one undoable size change. Cancellation, capture
loss, or a rejected change restores the document's size. Turning read-only on
ends an active resize without committing.

## Keyboard navigation

When the grid is focused and not editing:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Arrow keys | Move the focus one cell. |
| Ctrl/Cmd + Arrow | Jump to the first/last row or column. |
| Page Up / Page Down | Move by a viewport of rows. |
| Home / End | Move to the first / last column of the row. |
| Ctrl/Cmd + Home / End | Move to the sheet's first / last cell. |
| Shift + any of the above | Extend the selection instead of moving. |
| Enter or F2 | Edit the focused cell (F2 selects the existing text). |
| Delete / Backspace | Clear the selected cells. |
| A printable character | Start editing, replacing the cell's content. |
| Ctrl/Cmd + C / X / V | Copy / cut / paste. |
| Ctrl/Cmd + Z | Undo the last edit. |
| Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z (or Ctrl/Cmd + Y) | Redo. |
| Ctrl/Cmd + F | Open the find bar (when `config.find` is not `false`). |

## Undo and redo

`grid.undo()` and `grid.redo()` (and Ctrl/Cmd + Z, Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z) step
through the last 200 recorded transactions. Remote operations from a
`SyncCoordinator` do not create undo entries.

Undo of a large clear restores every old cell. When the restore is larger than
one transaction allows, the Grid sends one compressed `restoreBlock` operation.
If that still needs more than one server version, it uses an atomic batch,
which needs `PersistenceAdapter.commitBatch`. See
[Large undo and atomic batches](/docs/guides/collaboration/#large-undo-and-atomic-batches).

If the restore is above the batch ceilings, cannot be split, or needs a
`commitBatch` that the adapter does not have, `grid.undo()` changes nothing. The
Grid emits `mutation-rejected` with a `resource-limit` issue and removes that
entry from the history, so older edits can still be undone. Show the reason to
the user:

```ts prelude="core" partial="requires surrounding host state" title="Report an undo that is too large"
grid.on("mutation-rejected", ({ issues }) => {
  for (const issue of issues) {
    if (issue.kind === "resource-limit") {
      console.warn(`Not undone: ${issue.resource} ${issue.actual} is above ${issue.max}.`);
    }
  }
});
```

## Inline editing

Editing happens in a single real `<textarea>` overlaid on the active cell. It is
never recycled across cells, so **IME composition and focus survive scrolling** —
composing CJK or other input methods is safe. Begin editing by double-clicking,
pressing Enter or F2, or just typing.

Commit and navigation keys:

| Key | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Enter | Commit, move **down**. |
| Tab | Commit, move **right**. |
| Shift + Tab | Commit, move **left**. |
| Shift + Enter | Insert a newline (does not commit). |
| Escape | Cancel the edit. |
| Blur (click away) | Commit in place. |

While the IME is composing, keystrokes belong to the composition and are not
treated as navigation. Editing emits `edit-begin` and `edit-commit` events.

`beginEdit` selects the requested cell and emits `selection` when that changes
the selection, then emits `edit-begin` before opening the editor. A synchronous
handler can replace or cancel the request without the old editor reopening.
Successful completion emits `change`, then `edit-commit`, then the navigation's
`selection` event; rejected completion does not emit `edit-commit` or navigate.
Event addresses remain view coordinates.

Stock, validation, and custom editors retain the underlying document cell while
sorting or filtering changes its visible position. Completion writes that same
cell, not whichever row now occupies the old position. If the cell leaves the
view, or sheet structure changes, the editor is cancelled.

## Clipboard interoperability

Copy and cut always produce injection-hardened TSV and, where the browser exposes
`ClipboardItem`, also write sanitized `text/html` plus Sheetwrite's private
`application/x-sheetwrite+json` payload. The private payload preserves formula
source and cell styles for same-app round-trips. HTML contains only escaped table
markup, plain cell text, safe `data-sheetwrite-formula` attributes, and a bounded
style subset; no pasted HTML is inserted into the document.

Paste prefers the private Sheetwrite payload, then sanitized HTML tables, then
plain TSV. HTML parsing uses an inert `DOMParser` document and accepts only cell
text, safe formula attributes, and supported inline styles. External formulas
containing control characters are treated as text. TSV handles quoted,
multi-line fields, matching Excel and Google Sheets. External text beginning
with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab, or CR is prefixed with a single quote, so it cannot
become an executable formula.

`paste()` preserves supported formula/style data; `pasteValues()` intentionally
writes resolved literals and drops formulas/styles. Cut clears its source only
after the system clipboard accepts the payload. Paste is disabled when
`readOnly`.

`grid.actions.copy/cut/paste/pasteValues` return
`Promise<ClipboardOutcome>` — `"done" | "unsupported" | "blocked" | "empty"` —
and never reject. A missing API resolves `"unsupported"`; permission or
user-activation rejection resolves `"blocked"`, so custom UI can surface the
outcome without tripping global error monitoring.

## Validation, protection, and notes

`DataValidationRule` covers list, numeric range, date range, text-length, and
checkbox conditions. Rules carry a stable ID, range, `reject` / `warn` / `allow`
policy, optional blank handling, and help text. List rules open a keyboard-
operable `listbox`; checkbox rules open a real ARIA `checkbox`. Arrow keys and
typeahead change a list choice, Space toggles a checkbox, Enter commits, Tab
commits and moves, and Escape cancels. Every mutation ingress—including paste,
fill, clear, and host transactions—passes through the same validation boundary.

`ProtectedRange` is serializable client policy metadata. Local writes are denied
by default and can be allowed by a host `ProtectionResolver`; atomic mode rejects
the whole transaction, while partial mode applies allowed operations and reports
the rest. Remote operations bypass this UX policy. A server must enforce its own
authorization.

Plain-text notes use `setNote(addr, text)` / `getNote(addr)`. The focused cell's
note is exposed as the ARIA description. Notes serialize, rebase with structural
edits, participate in undo/redo, and round-trip through Sheetwrite XLSX metadata.

## Toolbar actions

When you opt into the toolbar via `config`, each control acts on the current
selection. The controls (and the `config` flag that gates each) are:

| Control | Flag |
| --- | --- |
| Bold | `bold` |
| Italic | `italic` |
| Align left / center / right | `align` |
| Text color | `textColor` |
| Fill color | `fillColor` |
| Border | `border` |
| Clear formatting | `clearFormat` |
| Merge / unmerge | `merge` |
| Sort ascending / descending | `sort` |

See [Configuration → GridConfig](/docs/guides/configuration/#gridconfig-toolbar).

## Context menu

`GridConfig.contextMenu` is `true` by default, `false` to disable, a static
readonly item list, or a factory evaluated for each right-click context.
Sheetwrite prevents the browser menu, hit-tests the pointer, and selects the
resolved cell before evaluating item visibility/disabled predicates.

Rows may provide `id`, `label`, and `shortcut`; bind a built-in `action` or use
`onClick(grid, cell)`. `visible` and `disabled` accept booleans or predicates
receiving the lean `{ cell, clientX, clientY }` `ContextMenuContext`. Hidden
separators are normalized and disabled rows cannot invoke actions.

The built-in action names are:

| Clipboard/content | Rows | Columns | View/export |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cut`, `copy`, `paste`, `clearContents` | `insertRowAbove`, `insertRowBelow`, `deleteRow`, `hideRow`, `showAllRows`, `autoFitRow` | `insertColumnLeft`, `insertColumnRight`, `deleteColumn`, `hideColumn`, `showAllColumns`, `autoFitColumn` | `clearFilter`, `merge`, `unmerge`, `exportCsv`, `exportXlsx` |

The default list uses the clipboard/content, row, column, filter, and
merge/unmerge actions; export actions are available for custom lists. XLSX
still requires `@sheetwrite/xlsx/register`.

For fully host-owned menu rendering, disable the bundled menu and bind the host
element's DOM `contextmenu` event. `grid.getCellAtPoint(clientX, clientY)`
resolves the pointer without exposing renderer internals; the host then owns
`preventDefault`, selection, positioning, dismissal, and invoking
`grid.actions`.

See [Configuration → Context-menu items](/docs/guides/configuration/#context-menu-items)
for both models and [Styling → Widget and context-menu styling](/docs/guides/styling/#widget-and-context-menu-styling)
for the bundled menu CSS hooks.

## Merged cells

Merging combines the selected range into one cell: the top-left value is shown and
the covered cells are hidden, tracked in a per-sheet merge registry. Unmerge
reverses it. Merges are **not drawn while a sort or filter view is active** (the
display order no longer maps cleanly to the merged region); clear the view to see
them again. See [Data operations](/docs/guides/data-operations/#display-views).

## Drag-to-fill

A small fill handle sits at the bottom-right corner of the selection. Drag it
**down, up, left, or right** — the dominant axis wins — to fill the source block
across the new region. The source is tiled (repeated) to cover the target.

When the filled cells contain formulas, references are rewritten as they are
copied: **relative** A1 parts shift by the fill offset and **absolute** parts
(prefixed with `$`) stay fixed. For example, filling `=A1 + $B$1` one column right
yields `=B1 + $B$1`. See [Formulas → Point mode and reference rewriting](/docs/guides/formulas/#point-mode-and-reference-rewriting).

Drag-to-fill is unavailable while a sort/filter view is active (the handle is
hidden) and when `readOnly`.

## Touch

Grid input runs on Pointer Events, so mouse, touch, and pen share one code
path. For `pointerType: "touch"` the policy is:

| Gesture | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Tap on a cell | select the cell (same as a click) |
| Tap on a column header | select the column |
| Drag starting on a plain cell | **native scroll** — the grid neither captures the pointer nor calls `preventDefault` |
| Drag starting on the fill handle | drag-to-fill (pointer captured) |
| Drag starting on a row/column resize boundary | resize (pointer captured) |
| Drag starting on the border of a multi-cell selection (±6px band) | extend the selection (pointer captured) |
| Double-tap on a cell | begin editing (the browser's synthesized `dblclick`) |

Mouse and pen behave classically: any drag from a cell extends the selection,
and hovering a resize boundary shows the resize cursor. A `pointercancel`
(e.g. the browser reclaims the gesture) abandons the drag without committing.
The scroller sets `touch-action: pan-x pan-y`, which keeps native panning but
disables double-tap zoom so captured drags keep receiving `pointermove`.
Long-press → context menu on touch is deferred; when added it must cancel on
move to respect the native-scroll rule.
