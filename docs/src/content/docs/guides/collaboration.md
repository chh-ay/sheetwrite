title: Collaboration and offline work
description: Sequence, persist, acknowledge, retry, and conservatively rebase Sheetwrite document operations.
---

Sheetwrite provides transport-, database-, and authentication-neutral collaboration primitives. The host still owns server sequencing, durable document storage, user identity, authorization, and network lifecycle.

## Load, mount, queue, and acknowledge

Load a validated snapshot before mounting, then let one `SyncCoordinator`
observe local grid transactions. Do not also save `event.changes`: that list is
cell-oriented rollback detail and omits document metadata operations.

```ts prelude="collaboration" partial="requires surrounding host state" title="Partial example"
import {
  createGridFromSnapshot,
  SyncCoordinator,
  type PersistenceAdapter,
  type RemoteOperationSource,
} from "@sheetwrite/core";

const documentId = "workbook-42";
const snapshot = await persistenceAdapter.load(documentId);
const grid = createGridFromSnapshot(document.querySelector("#grid")!, snapshot);
const sync = new SyncCoordinator(grid, persistenceAdapter, {
  documentId,
  serverVersion: snapshot.version ?? 0,
});

sync.on((event) => {
  if (event.type === "acknowledged") {
    console.log(`server version ${event.version} acknowledged ${event.clientMutationId}`);
  } else if (event.type === "conflict") {
    console.error("conflict retained for host recovery", event.mutation);
  }
});

await sync.ready();
const unsubscribeRemote = sync.subscribe(remoteOperationSource);

saveButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  void sync.flush(); // sends in order; each response acknowledges only its mutation ID
});

// Teardown:
// unsubscribeRemote();
// sync.destroy();
// grid.destroy();
```

`SyncCoordinator` subscribes to `Grid` changes itself. Local rendering remains
optimistic; the host controls when to call `sendNext`, `flush`, or `retry`.
`applied` and `duplicate` responses acknowledge the matching operations and
remove that mutation. A transport error leaves the immutable record pending.

An HTTP adapter can stay transport-neutral at the core boundary:

```ts prelude="collaboration" partial="requires surrounding host state" title="Partial example"
import type {
  PersistenceAdapter,
  PersistenceBatchCommitRequest,
  PersistenceCommitRequest,
  PersistenceCommitResponse,
  WorkbookSnapshot,
} from "@sheetwrite/core";

async function responseJson<T>(response: Response): Promise<T> {
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Persistence request failed: ${response.status}`);
  return (await response.json()) as T;
}

const persistenceAdapter: PersistenceAdapter = {
  async load(documentId, signal) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/documents/${encodeURIComponent(documentId)}`, { signal });
    return responseJson<WorkbookSnapshot>(response);
  },
  async commit(request: PersistenceCommitRequest) {
    const { signal, ...body } = request;
    const response = await fetch(
      `/api/documents/${encodeURIComponent(request.documentId)}/operations`,
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(body),
        signal,
      },
    );
    return responseJson<PersistenceCommitResponse>(response);
  },
  // Required for undo of very large edits; see "Large undo and atomic batches".
  async commitBatch(request: PersistenceBatchCommitRequest) {
    const { signal, ...body } = request;
    const response = await fetch(
      `/api/documents/${encodeURIComponent(request.documentId)}/operation-batches`,
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(body),
        signal,
      },
    );
    return responseJson<PersistenceCommitResponse>(response);
  },
};
```

The server must authenticate the request, authorize every operation, validate
the document schema/policy, and assign the version. Client protection metadata
is not authorization.

## Database-neutral server model

A snapshot plus append-only operation log is the default persistence shape:

```sql partial="illustrative output or schema" title="Illustrative excerpt"
documents(
  document_id       primary key,
  current_version   integer not null,
  snapshot_version  integer not null,
  snapshot_json     json not null
)

document_operations(
  document_id        not null,
  version            integer not null,
  client_mutation_id text not null,
  operations_json    json not null,
  created_at         server_timestamp not null,
  primary key(document_id, version),
  unique(document_id, client_mutation_id)
)
```

Handle `commit()` in one database transaction:

1. Return `duplicate` with the existing version when
   `(document_id, client_mutation_id)` already exists.
2. Lock/read the document version. If it differs from `baseVersion`, return
   `conflict` with ordered operations since base or a current snapshot.
3. Validate and authorize the submitted `DocumentOp[]` on the server.
4. Append at `current_version + 1`, update the document version, and return
   `applied` with the same mutation ID.
5. Periodically fold the log into `snapshot_json`; never rewrite operation
   versions or accept client-authored server timestamps.

Handle `commitBatch()` the same way, with one difference: the request has
`versionOperationCounts`, and it fills several consecutive versions. In one
database transaction, check the duplicate and the base version once, validate
every version, then append all of them or none. Store each version with its
`batch: { index, count }` position, and acknowledge with the last version.

Normalized cell tables are an alternative for products that need SQL queries
over cell values. They do not replace the protocol: the host must still
reconstruct a complete schema-versioned `WorkbookSnapshot`, preserve formula
source/style/metadata, and serialize structural operations under one document
version. Mixing independent cell writes with the operation log breaks atomic
row/column/formula semantics.

## Large undo and atomic batches

Undo of a large clear restores the old cells. When the ordinary `setBlock`
operation is too large for one version, the Grid sends one `restoreBlock`
operation instead: the same cells as compressed JSON (`deflate-json-v1`). If
even that does not fit one version, the Grid splits the restore into an atomic
batch of up to 16 versions and 64 MiB. Undo stays one history step and one
`change` event.

Before you accept 0.5.0 clients, make sure that your server:

1. accepts `restoreBlock` wherever it switches over the `DocumentOp` union, and
   decodes it as untrusted input. `@sheetwrite/core` does not export a server
   decoder, so your decoder must do these checks, in this order, before it
   changes the document:
   - `encoding` is `"deflate-json-v1"`, and `decodedBytes` is a positive
     integer of at most 64 MiB;
   - `data` is canonical base64 (it decodes and re-encodes to the same text);
   - the raw DEFLATE stream inflates into a buffer of exactly `decodedBytes`
     bytes. Never inflate without that output limit: a small stream can expand
     to gigabytes. Reject a stream that ends early or has bytes left over;
   - the bytes are valid UTF-8 JSON of a `PackedCellBlock` whose row and
     column counts match `range`, with at most 4,000,000 cells;
   - every value, formula, reference, and style in the block passes the same
     validation as a `setBlock` operation;
2. implements `commitBatch` as above, or accepts that `SyncCoordinator`
   rejects a local step that needs more than one version;
3. publishes batch members with their `batch` field, so that peers apply the
   whole batch at once; and
4. folds `restoreBlock` into snapshots as ordinary cells. Snapshots never
   store restore streams.

The [document operations reference](/docs/reference/document-operations/#atomic-multi-version-batches)
has the exact field rules, limits, and error codes. When an undo is above the
transaction limits even after this, the Grid changes nothing and reports it;
see [Interaction](/docs/guides/interaction/#undo-and-redo).

## Durable pending commits

`SyncCoordinator` can receive a `PendingCommitStorage` adapter. With one configured, it:

1. persists each immutable commit before it can be sent;
2. restores pending commits on startup and reapplies them locally as remote-source operations, so restoration does not echo into the outgoing queue;
3. retries with the original `clientMutationId` after reconnect or reload;
4. removes durable work only after an `applied` or `duplicate` acknowledgement; and
5. retains conflicts and storage failures for explicit host recovery.

Await `coordinator.ready()` before declaring startup synchronized. Use `initialConnection: "offline"` for offline-first startup, `setOnline(false)` on disconnect, and `setOnline(true)` to reconnect and drain pending work in order. `coordinator.state` distinguishes connection state from hydration, persistence, sending, conflict, and error activity.

The browser IndexedDB implementation is intentionally isolated from Node and SSR entrypoints:

```ts prelude="collaboration" partial="requires surrounding host state" title="Partial example"
import { SyncCoordinator } from "@sheetwrite/core";
import { IndexedDbPendingCommitStorage } from "@sheetwrite/core/browser";

const pendingStorage = new IndexedDbPendingCommitStorage({
  databaseName: "my-product-sheetwrite",
});

const sync = new SyncCoordinator(grid, persistenceAdapter, {
  documentId: "workbook-42",
  serverVersion: snapshot.version ?? 0,
  pendingStorage,
  initialConnection: navigator.onLine ? "online" : "offline",
});

await sync.ready();
window.addEventListener("online", () => sync.setOnline(true));
window.addEventListener("offline", () => sync.setOnline(false));
```

IndexedDB record migration is versioned. Unsupported future schemas, blocked upgrades, quota exhaustion, transaction failures, and aborts surface as typed `IndexedDbPendingCommitStorageError` codes. Core continues to work without IndexedDB when no durable adapter is supplied.

## Remote operations and version gaps

`SyncCoordinator.subscribe` accepts either `RemoteOperationSource` or `AsyncIterable<VersionedOperation>`. Operations apply only at `serverVersion + 1`; own echoed mutation IDs and already acknowledged IDs are deduplicated. Remote application uses `Grid.applyRemoteOperations`, so it does not create outgoing dirty work or local undo entries.

A gap emits `reload-required`. Prefer fetching missing ordered operations through
`recoverVersionGap`; the coordinator applies them in sequence. A returned
snapshot is a host remount signal, not an automatic store replacement.
`resumeAfterReload(snapshot)` updates retained queue base versions only after the
host has installed that snapshot and reapplied local work; it does not hydrate a
grid or attach the coordinator to a newly created grid.

### Conflict and snapshot reload

Never acknowledge or discard a conflicted mutation implicitly. If the server
returns both `operationsSinceBase` and a current snapshot, the host can gate
every pending transaction through the conservative rebaser, clear the old
durable IDs, remount, and submit the safe results as new mutations:

```ts prelude="collaboration" partial="requires surrounding host state" title="Partial example"
import {
  createGridFromSnapshot,
  rebaseDocumentOperations,
  SyncCoordinator,
  type Grid,
  type PersistenceCommitResponse,
} from "@sheetwrite/core";

type ConflictResponse = Extract<PersistenceCommitResponse, { status: "conflict" }>;
interface SyncSession {
  grid: Grid;
  sync: SyncCoordinator;
  unsubscribeRemote: () => void;
}

async function reloadAfterConflict(
  session: SyncSession,
  response: ConflictResponse,
): Promise<SyncSession> {
  if (!response.operationsSinceBase) {
    console.error("Manual conflict review required: server did not return an operation tail");
    return session;
  }

  const pending = session.sync.pendingCommits();
  const remoteOperations = response.operationsSinceBase.flatMap((entry) => [
    ...entry.operations,
  ]);
  const safeBatches: Array<ReturnType<typeof rebaseDocumentOperations> & {
    status: "rebased";
  }> = [];

  for (const record of pending) {
    const result = rebaseDocumentOperations(record.operations, remoteOperations);
    if (result.status === "conflict") {
      console.error("Manual conflict review required", result.conflict);
      return session; // old queue and grid remain intact
    }
    safeBatches.push(result);
  }

  const latest = response.snapshot ?? (await persistenceAdapter.load(documentId));
  for (const record of pending) {
    await pendingStorage.remove(documentId, record.clientMutationId);
  }

  session.unsubscribeRemote();
  session.sync.destroy();
  session.grid.destroy();

  const grid = createGridFromSnapshot(document.querySelector("#grid")!, latest);
  const sync = new SyncCoordinator(grid, persistenceAdapter, {
    documentId,
    serverVersion: latest.version ?? 0,
    pendingStorage,
  });
  await sync.ready(); // the stale IDs were removed before hydration

  for (const batch of safeBatches) {
    const outcome = grid.applyTransaction({ patches: [...batch.operations] });
    if (outcome.status !== "applied") {
      throw new Error(`Rebased local transaction was not applied: ${outcome.status}`);
    }
  }

  const unsubscribeRemote = sync.subscribe(remoteOperationSource);
  await sync.flush();
  return { grid, sync, unsubscribeRemote };
}
```

When the rebaser reports `conflict`—overlap, formulas across structural changes,
concurrent moves, or sheet lifecycle ambiguity—keep the original queue and show
product-specific conflict UI. If the server returns only a snapshot, the host
cannot infer a safe transform; offer explicit discard/export/manual re-entry
instead. Reloading a snapshot over pending edits without this decision loses
intent.

## Presence

`PresenceCoordinator` publishes actor metadata, active sheet, and bounded selection ranges through a host `PresenceTransport`. Presence:

- is never written to document operations, snapshots, dirty state, or history;
- expires according to local heartbeat receipt time;
- is bounded by actor and range limits;
- clamps ranges to valid visible grid geometry and hides other-sheet or filtered selections;
- reuses the grid overlay element pool rather than mutating canvas cells; and
- supports privacy controls for display name, selections, inbound presence, and actor filtering.

Presence is advisory UI state. Do not use it for authorization, locking, or conflict prevention.

## Revisions

`RevisionCoordinator` delegates revision listing, loading, and restore to a `RevisionAdapter`. Preview snapshots pass through the optional host schema migrator and mount with `readOnly: true`. Restore requests include `targetVersion`, current `baseVersion`, and a stable mutation ID. The adapter contract requires restore to create a newer auditable server version; it must never rewind database state in place.

## Comments

Comments are document-adjacent server entities, not fields on every cell. `CommentCoordinator` stores stable thread/message IDs and range or cell anchors, while adapters supply authenticated author references and server timestamps. Create, reply, and resolve requests contain no client-authored identity or time fields. Authorization remains entirely host/server-owned.

Comment streams are versioned independently. Out-of-order events emit a gap rather than being applied speculatively.

## Concurrent structural editing decision

Sheetwrite uses deterministic server ordering plus conservative rebase, not a CRDT or general OT layer.

`rebaseDocumentOperations` safely shifts non-overlapping literal edits and references across server-ordered row/column insertions and deletions. It reports explicit conflicts for:

- edits or range pastes overlapping inserted/deleted boundaries;
- targets or references deleted by a concurrent operation;
- formula source crossing structural edits, because text-only rewriting cannot preserve sheet-aware reference intent;
- concurrent row/column moves;
- conflicting sheet lifecycle operations; and
- metadata families that need domain-specific transforms.

This choice preserves stable sheet IDs and authoritative formula source without lossy adapters. A CRDT/OT dependency is not justified by current scenarios: short-lived offline and online collaboration converge under server sequencing, while long-lived offline concurrent structural edits require product-level conflict UX and spreadsheet-specific formula/range semantics that generic sequence CRDTs do not supply. Revisit only if requirements demand automatic preservation of those ambiguous edits and scenario tests define the intended result for every structural/formula case.
