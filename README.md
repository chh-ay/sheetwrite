# Sheetwrite

A canvas spreadsheet and data grid backed by a Rust/WASM columnar engine, with imperative core and React, Vue, and Svelte adapters.

## Framework lane

Install one adapter. Core and WASM arrive transitively.

```sh
bun add @sheetwrite/react
```

```tsx
import { Sheetwrite } from "@sheetwrite/react";
import "@sheetwrite/react/styles.css";

<Sheetwrite
  columns={[
    { key: "name", title: "Name" },
    { key: "price", title: "Price", type: "currency" },
  ]}
  defaultRows={products}
  height={500}
  onGridChange={(event) => console.log(event.source, event.transaction.patches)}
/>;
```

Use the equivalent `Sheetwrite` export and package-local `styles.css` from `@sheetwrite/vue` or `@sheetwrite/svelte`. Framework components initialize WASM automatically on client mount.

`defaultRows` is an uncontrolled seed. Sheetwrite never mutates it; edits live in the grid. Changing its identity deliberately replaces the grid and creates a new readiness generation. Use `height` for fixed sizing or `fill` inside an ancestor that already has available height.

`onGridChange` is an observation hook, not an acknowledgement protocol. For
durable/versioned writes use `SyncCoordinator`; do not persist only
`event.changes`, which omits non-cell document operations.

`SheetwriteGrid` remains the advanced component for explicit `workbook` plus `data`/`datasource`. Reset-bound inputs are `workbook`, `data`, `datasource`, `datasourceStorage`, `renderer`, `workerUrl`, and `renderers`. Live inputs are `theme`, `readOnly`, `config`, `overscan`, and `minColumns`.

Readiness reports `{ grid, generation, reason }`, where reason is `initial`, `input-reset`, or `renderer-reset`. Grid events use collision-free names: `onGridChange`/`grid-change`, `onViewportChange`/`viewport-change`, selection, edit, search, and active-sheet variants. Native host change and scroll events remain available.

## Engine lane

```sh
bun add @sheetwrite/core
```

```ts
import { createGrid, initSheetwrite, type Workbook } from "@sheetwrite/core";
import "@sheetwrite/core/styles.css";

await initSheetwrite();

const workbook: Workbook = {
  activeSheet: "sheet1",
  sheets: [
    {
      id: "sheet1",
      name: "Products",
      rowCount: 2,
      columns: [
        { key: "name", header: "Name", width: 180, type: "text" },
        { key: "price", header: "Price", width: 100, type: "currency" },
      ],
    },
  ],
};

const grid = createGrid(document.querySelector("#grid")!, {
  workbook,
  data: {
    rowCount: 2,
    columns: { name: ["Notebook", "Pen"], price: [12.5, 2.25] },
  },
});
```

Zero-argument initialization is canonical and re-entrant. Explicit WASM sources remain available for unsupported bundlers or controlled asset delivery; see [Installation](https://sheetwrite.vercel.app/docs/start/installation/).

## Optional XLSX backend

Core and every framework adapter install without a concrete XLSX codec. Add the
optional backend only when the application chooses XLSX support:

```sh
bun add @sheetwrite/xlsx
```

```ts
import "@sheetwrite/xlsx/register";
import {
  fromXlsxTable,
  fromXlsxWorkbook,
  toXlsxTable,
  toXlsxWorkbook,
} from "@sheetwrite/core";
```

`grid.exportXlsx()` and framework toolbar XLSX actions use the table backend and
therefore require registration. `toXlsxTable` / `fromXlsxTable` provide
first-row-header, first-sheet interchange; `toXlsxWorkbook` /
`fromXlsxWorkbook` preserve multi-sheet snapshots, formula source, native
workbook tables and structured references, safe HTTPS/mailto or internal
hyperlinks, and the declared bounded conditional-format subset. Unsupported
OOXML table/format extensions emit structured warnings instead of silently
flattening into supported behavior. Calling any XLSX function without
registration throws an error naming the exact package and registration import.
CSV and TSV remain core-only. See [XLSX and export](https://sheetwrite.vercel.app/docs/guides/xlsx-export/)
and the [detailed compatibility results](https://sheetwrite.vercel.app/docs/reference/compatibility-results/)
for the exact supported features, limits, and test evidence.

## Persistence

Snapshots are the authoritative, JSON-safe persistence boundary. Hosts own
storage; core never embeds a database or endpoint:

```ts
import { createGridFromSnapshot, SyncCoordinator } from "@sheetwrite/core";

const snapshot = await adapter.load("products");
const grid = createGridFromSnapshot(document.querySelector("#grid")!, snapshot);
const sync = new SyncCoordinator(grid, adapter, {
  documentId: "products",
  serverVersion: snapshot.version ?? 0,
});

await sync.ready();
const unsubscribeRemote = sync.subscribe(remoteOperationSource);
saveButton.onclick = () => void sync.flush(); // ordered mutation IDs + acknowledgements

const backup = grid.exportSnapshot();
grid.applyRemoteOperations(remoteOperations); // observable, not dirty or undoable
```

See [Persistence and collaboration](https://sheetwrite.vercel.app/docs/guides/collaboration/)
for the host adapter, pending queue, conflict reload, conservative rebase,
presence, comments, and revisions.

## v0.3 roadmap status

Implemented on the development branch: complete worksheet lifecycle operations,
more portable formulas, native workbook tables and structured references, safe
links, bounded conditional formatting, and 2,350 checked examples. Each example
is either an original Sheetwrite test or links to the public specification it
uses. The results show exactly what Sheetwrite does today; they do not claim
blanket Excel or Google Sheets compatibility.

The v0.3 release is still waiting on fresh test runs in Excel and Google Sheets,
workbook save-and-open checks between apps, unchanged download-size limits, the
measured decision on billion-cell sheets, stable row-model and executable
onboarding work, and final browser checks for every product showcase. See the
[detailed compatibility results](https://sheetwrite.vercel.app/docs/reference/compatibility-results/)
for supported features, warnings, known limits, app versions, and test evidence.

## Releases

Changesets maintain independent package versions and package-level changelogs
linked from the root [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). Merging changes with pending
changesets updates one version pull request. After its version commit passes CI
on `develop`, publication downloads and rehashes that exact run's canonical
tarballs, verifies and skips package versions already on npm, and publishes only
unpublished versions in dependency order with provenance. Registry verification
finishes before package-specific tags and GitHub Releases such as
`@sheetwrite/xlsx@0.2.1` are created.

## Development

Contributor and CI tooling is pinned to Bun 1.4.2, Rust 1.98.1 with the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, wasm-pack 0.15.0, and cargo-audit 0.22.2.
The Bun engine range in `package.json` describes supported consumers; the
`packageManager` field and `rust-toolchain.toml` define the exact contributor
toolchain. Node 26.9.0 is the CI and development runtime; the `engines.node`
value tracks the Node line the documentation deployment supports.

```sh
rustup toolchain install
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run toolchain:install-wasm-pack
cargo install cargo-audit --version 0.22.2 --locked
```

The canonical clean-output proof builds in a temporary source export and never
deletes working-tree files:

```sh
bun run verify:clean-build
```

For the complete local CI graph, install Chromium once, then run the ordered
non-browser graph and browser gate. `browser:install` installs the Playwright
browser and its operating-system dependencies.

```sh
bun run browser:install
bun run verify:ci
bun run test:browser
```

Focused contributor commands remain available:

```sh
bun run build:packages
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun test
bun run build:examples
bun run verify:packed
bun run verify:bundlers
bun run size:report
```

`size:report` records package, bundle, stylesheet, and WASM sizes without enforcing a release ceiling.
