Use coordinate-keyed hashing for engine cell indexes while retaining randomized hashing for workbook text. Content clears, packed writes, and column writes retain unrelated calculated values and spills and recalculate only their dependent formulas, including cross-sheet and range readers. Large rectangles use bounded range dirty tracking instead of whole-sheet invalidation; style-only clears do not invalidate calculations.

Consolidate engine ownership: CellStorage owns paged storage and local dirty overlays; graph owns formula entries, the dependency index, and recompute dirty state; spill admission accesses cells through storage; window owns conditional-rule caching. Dirty-state memory accounting and internal memory transfers preserve the active cell, rectangle, or whole-sheet representation.
