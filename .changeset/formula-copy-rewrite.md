Paste, fill and conditional-format rules now rewrite formula references with the engine's own rules (part of #246). `=SUM(A:A)` pasted one column right becomes `=SUM(B:B)`, and a name such as `XYZ1`, past the last column, stays a name instead of becoming `#REF!`. A row or column insert, delete or move rewrites whole columns and rows in conditional-format formulas too. Only the references that change are rewritten, so the rest of the formula keeps its spacing and case.

The engines export `translateFormula`, `shiftFormulaAxis` and `moveFormulaAxis`. `shiftA1Refs` from `@sheetwrite/core` now calls the engine, so it needs `initSheetwrite()` first. `rebaseDocumentOperations` needs it too when it moves a conditional format that has a formula.
