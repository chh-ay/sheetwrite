XLSX import now builds the snapshot cells while it reads the worksheet rows, so each cell has one representation in memory instead of two. Restoring Sheetwrite sidecar fields now indexes only the sidecar cells, not all cells. Snapshot validation now finds duplicate cells with sorted numeric keys instead of a set of text keys, builds cell paths only for cells that fail, and counts the bytes of integers without making text. Validation results are the same. On generated 200,000 × 8 and 1,000,000 × 8 workbooks, over seven interleaved rounds for each side, the median import peak RSS went from 1,095 MiB to 800 MiB and from 5,061 MiB to 3,352 MiB (buffered). With `fromXlsxWorkbookFile`, it went from 1,112 MiB to 779 MiB and from 4,475 MiB to 3,336 MiB. The highest candidate run was lower than the median baseline run in all four cases, and the median import time decreased by about 20%.
