Opening and saving an XLSX file now keeps the parts Sheetwrite does not model: charts, pivot tables, images, VBA projects, customXml, XML maps, data connections, themes and document properties. They are kept as their original compressed bytes in the new `WorkbookSnapshot.workbook.xlsxSource` and written back unchanged. Charts and pivots are dropped with a warning once a cell changes, images once their sheet's rows or columns move, and VBA and customXml always survive. The new `maxPreservedBytes` resource limit (64 MiB by default) bounds the kept data.

Table autofilter rules, sort state, calculated-column formulas and totals-row functions now round-trip through XLSX.

New streaming functions `toCsvStream`, `toTsvStream`, `toXlsxTableStream` and `toXlsxWorkbookStream` return a `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`, and `fromXlsxWorkbookFile` imports a `Blob` without buffering every part. The existing functions are unchanged.

Import no longer writes the workbook's default font size onto every cell; only cells with a different size get a `fontSize` style.
