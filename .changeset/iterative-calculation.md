Add iterative calculation for circular references, as in Excel. The new `setCalculation` document operation sets `{ iterate, maxIterations, maxChange }`. The defaults are the Excel defaults: off, 100 iterations, and a maximum change of 0.001. When iteration is off, a circular reference shows `#CYCLE!`, as before. When it is on, the engine calculates each circular reference again until no value changes by more than `maxChange`, or until `maxIterations` passes are done. A cycle that does not settle keeps the values of its last pass. Formulas that read a cycle calculate once, after it settles. `OFFSET`, `INDIRECT` and volatile functions work inside a cycle, and a cycle that only `OFFSET` or `INDIRECT` closes also iterates.

The setting is undoable and is part of the workbook snapshot as `workbook.calculation`. Snapshots of workbooks with the default setting do not change. XLSX import reads `iterate`, `iterateCount` and `iterateDelta` from `<calcPr>`, and export writes them. The WASM `CellStore` has the new `setIterativeCalculation` method. Core exports `CalculationSettings`, `DEFAULT_MAX_ITERATIONS`, `DEFAULT_MAX_CHANGE` and `MAX_ITERATIONS`.

The engine finds circular references once per recalculation, only when the dependency check finds a cycle, so workbooks without one do no extra work.
