Write cell formulas with Excel's future-function and local-binding prefixes, including LET, LAMBDA, XLOOKUP, FILTER and SORT, and remove those prefixes on import. Cells and defined names now share the engine converter, including the A1# spill spelling.

Convert each workbook's distinct formulas in one batch instead of crossing the JavaScript-to-WASM boundary for every cell. Reuse an initialized engine or retire a temporary conversion instance. Formula-free workbooks, including workbooks with only range names, do not load an engine.
